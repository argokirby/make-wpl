Make WPL
========

Creates Windows Media Player Playlist Files (.wpl) from Zune Playlist Files (.zpl), without affecting the original files.

## Requirements

The latest version of Ruby must be installed on your machine before use

## Usage

To use make_wpl, do the following steps:
 
 1. Place the make_wpl.rb into the directory that contains your Zune Playlist (.zpl) files 
 2. Execute make_wpl.rb
 
The program will create a NEW .wpl file for each .zpl in the directory.

## Notes

The Zune software deprecated this conversion feature from their product because it was unstable. There's a possibility that your .wpl files will not work in certain circumstances. However, I have never had a problem with it.
